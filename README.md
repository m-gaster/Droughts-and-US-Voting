# Droughts-and-US-Voting

This repository expands the research of Bruckner and Ciccone (2011) (who found that the negative exogenous economic shocks which followed droughts in sub-Saharan Africa were solid contributors to / predictors of democratic revolutions)

My goal is to identify the effects of drought on US voting in heavily agricultural districts.

I have a few hypotheses:

* These negative economic shocks make voters more supportive of candidates who support more redistributive policies. 
  * In general, the Democratic party is perceived as more supportive of welfare redistribution, but this may not be the case for farmers' welfare specifically. 
* These shocks make incumbents more likely to lose
  * Similarly, they should decrease incumbent voteshare
