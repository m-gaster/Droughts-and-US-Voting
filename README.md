# Droughts-and-US-Voting

This repository expands the research of Bruckner and Ciccone (2011) (who found that the negative exogenous economic shocks which followed droughts in sub-Saharan Africa were solid contributors to / predictors of democratic revolutions)

My goal is to identify the effects of drought on US voting in heavily agricultural districts.

I have a few hypotheses:

* These negative economic shocks make voters more supportive of candidates who support more redistributive policies. 
  * In general, the Democratic party is perceived as more supportive of welfare redistribution, but this may not be the case for farmers' welfare specifically. 
* These shocks make incumbents more likely to lose
  * Similarly, they should decrease incumbent voteshare


I have a few reasons for choosing to extend this analysis to the United States in particular:

* Bruckner & Ciccone's original result was for very poor countries - it's worth examining the impact on wealthy countries
* The US is large enough to have agricultural and non-agricultural districts (which can serve as controls)
* The US has extensive data available online
* Unlike most OECD countries, the US only has two main political parties - this creates a one-dimensional political spectrum which is easier to measure changes in
* I'm American and personally curious about the results here
