# Droughts-and-US-Voting

This repository expands the research of Bruckner and Ciccone (2011) (who found that the negative exogenous economic shocks which followed droughts in sub-Saharan Africa were solid contributors to / predictors of democratic revolutions)

My goal is to identify the effects of drought on US voting in heavily agricultural districts.
